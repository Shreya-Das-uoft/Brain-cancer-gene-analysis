# Brain-cancer-gene-analysis


## Aim: To identify which genes have differential gene expression profiles in 4 different cancers compared to healthy tissue.

This dataset has gene expression data from 78 cancer microarray datasets that have been classified into 5 different categories:
1. **Ependymoma** (A type of brain cancer that begins that the ependyma or cells that line the fluid-filled cavities of the brain)
2. **Glioblastoma** (A type of brain cancer that begins in astrocytes or the cells that support neurons)
3. **Medulloblastoma** (A type of brain cancer that occurs in the lower part of the brain, affecting the cerebellum)
4. **Pilyocytic Astrocytoma** (A types of brain cancer that begins in the central nervous system or CNS, which includes the brain and spinal cord)
5. **Healthy tissue**

# What is the Main Goal?
11 years ago marked the completion of the Human Genome Project (2003), one of the most intensive and innovative projects in the history of genome research. The outcomes of this project included the generation of new tools to analyzed huge amounts of genomic data and identify genes that are associated with different diseases.

Since then, many skilled scientists have been able to use these tools to identify many gene targets of different diseases that have been used in diagnosis and gene therapies. 

In this project, the goal is to find genes that have differential gene expression profiles compared to healthy tissue, which may indicate which gene are genetic markers or targets for gene therapy.

# What are Miccroarrays?
Microarrays are a type of high throughput gene expression profiling method used today to understand which genes are expressed at high or low levels in different samples.
